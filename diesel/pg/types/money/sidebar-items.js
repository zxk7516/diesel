The fractional precision of the value is determined by the `lc_monetary` setting of the database. This struct is re-exported as `Cents` as a convenient and conventional expression of a typical unit of 1/100th of currency. For other names or precisions, users might consider a differently named `use` of the `PgMoney` struct."]]});
